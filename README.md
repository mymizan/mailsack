Dummy SMTP Server Written in Python With A Simple UI

Mailsack contains a dummy smtp server to intercept mail from localhost and an UI written in TK interface to view
the mails. I personally use the daemon on the dev server. The simple UI is for my development machine. The UI can connect to remote host or local host to show intercepted mails by the server.

Feel free to use and fork! Any suggestions or contributions are welcome.
